I am currently a fourth year undergraduate from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/). I am interested in web development, machine learning and NLP.

Work Experience 
-------
- **Machine Learning Research Intern at UC San Diego, Design Lab**
  - *June 2022 - Present*(Virtual)
  - Collect social media posts using python and R scripts that I created.
  - Develop a framework for collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing text from social media posts for research analysis that will be done in Professor [Imani N.S. Munyaka](http://imanimunyaka.com/)'s lab.
  - Analyze social media posts using the latest techniques in natural language processing (sentiment analysis, N-grams, topic modeling, text networks) 
  - Analyze social media posts using various python and Twitter APIs to provide descriptive statistics (bot detection, emoji counts, identify influencers)
  - Provided literature review on previous work related to summer research topic
    - Mini Project [Reddit post comments analysis](https://github.com/Akshay024/Reddit-Post-Comments-Analysis) : Requires collecting comments from posts on Reddit and analyze the comments on reddit post using NLP techniques in python.

Projects
------

- [**DARK ADDER**]() | Mentor : Dr. Urbi Chatterjee, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur | [Research Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JPTTws5jTagQGjcGcb7b7tbhjXk73ePu/view?usp=sharing) 
  - Developed a digital Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH) that renders approximate adder circuitâ€™s inefficiency
  - Exploited the probabilistic nature of approximate designs to successfully implant the Hardware Trojan Horse
  - The presented Hardware Trojan Horse replaces the original sum-bit generation logic in a 1-bit full adder widely present as a building block in a major class of block-based low latency approximate adders
  - Impact of a digital HTH may be mild in exact computing designs, but it alters the behaviour of approximate circuits in practical scenarios such as machine learning (K-means clustering) & image processing (Gaussian Smoothing)
  - Dark Adder : Digital Hardware Trojan Attacks on Block based adders by Vishesh Mishra, Neelofar Hassan, _Akshay Mehta_, and Dr. Urbi Chatterjee was accepted at The 36th International Conference on VLSI Design (VLSID 2023)

- [**DESIGN LOGIC GATES**](https://github.com/BibekLakra91/EE619_project-3) | Course Project, VLSI System Design
  - Designed the 2-input NAND, NOR and XOR gate in complementary static CMOS logic using LTspice and Electric tools
  - Validated the design rule check (DRC) and the layout vs schematic (LVS) check for each and every gate

- [Audioband](https://github.com/Akshay024/AudioBand): Worked with 10 other IITK students, to assembled a wrist worn device to recognise hand gestures using ultrasonic beam forming and acoustic reflectometry under *Electronics Club, IITK*

- [Algorithms based on maths]():Learned the programming techniques and their time complexity analysis such as Hashing, Modular multiplication inverse,
Matrix Exponentiations, Dynamic Programming,etc. under *Stamatics, IITK*

- [Todos-Application](https://github.com/Akshay024/Todos-Application) and [Linear_Regression](https://github.com/Akshay024/Linear_Regression) are my self projects to get familar with the technologies.
